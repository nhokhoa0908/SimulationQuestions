Tasks
-

All physical cabling is in place. Configurations should ensure that connectivity is established end-to-end.

1. Configure a route on R1 to ensure that R1 prefers R2 to reach the 2001:db8:41::/64
network
2. Configure a floating route on R1, and ensure that R1 uses R3 to reach the 2001 :db8:41::/64 network if the connection between R1 and R2 is down
3. Ping and traceroute should be working

### Task 1: Configure a route on R1 to ensure that R1 prefers R2 to reach the 2001:db8:41::/64 network

On R1, configure a static route via R2:

```shell
R1(config)# ipv6 unicast-routing
R1(config)# ipv6 route 2001:db8:41::/64 2001:db8:12::2
```

### Task 2: Configure a floating route on R1, ensuring R1 uses R3 to reach the 2001:db8:41::/64 network if the connection between R1 and R2 is down

On R1, configure a floating static route with a higher administrative distance:

```shell
R1(config)# ipv6 route 2001:db8:41::/64 2001:db8:13::2 200
```

### Task 3: Ensure end-to-end connectivity

Configure necessary static routes on R2, R3, and R4 to ensure end-to-end connectivity. Each router should be aware of the routes to other networks. Here's a more comprehensive configuration:

#### R2:
```shell
R2(config)# ipv6 unicast-routing
R2(config)# ipv6 route 2001:db8:41::/64 2001:db8:24::2
```

#### R3:
```shell
R3(config)# ipv6 unicast-routing
R3(config)# ipv6 route 2001:db8:41::/64 2001:db8:34::2
R3(config)# ipv6 route 2001:db8:12::/64 2001:db8:13::2
```

#### R4:
```shell
R4(config)# ipv6 unicast-routing
R4(config)# ipv6 route 2001:db8:12::/64 2001:db8:24::1
R4(config)# ipv6 route 2001:db8:13::/64 2001:db8:34::1
```
