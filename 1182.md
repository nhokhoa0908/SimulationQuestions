We need to create subnets for 16 new sites from the 172.16.0.0/16 network.

To maximize the number of hosts for each site, we need to determine the optimal subnet size. Given 16 sites, we need 4 bits for the subnets (since 2^4 = 16). This leaves 12 bits for hosts within each subnet.

#### Calculate the Subnet Size:
- Original Network: 172.16.0.0/16
- Subnets required: 16 (requires 4 bits for subnets)
- Subnet Mask: /20 (16 + 4 = 20)

Thus, each subnet will be 172.16.0.0/20, which provides 4096 - 2 = 4094 usable IP addresses per subnet.

#### Second Subnet:
- Subnet: 172.16.16.0/20
- First Usable IP: 172.16.16.1
- Last Usable IP: 172.16.31.254

### Assign IP Addresses:
- **Sw101**: First usable IP address on e0/0: 172.16.16.1
- **Sw102**: Last usable IP address on e0/0: 172.16.31.254

#### Configuration:
```shell
! Configuration for Sw101
interface e0/0
  ip address 172.16.16.1 255.255.240.0
  no shutdown

! Configuration for Sw102
interface e0/0
  ip address 172.16.31.254 255.255.240.0
  no shutdown
```

### Task 2: Subnet 2001:DB8::/50 to meet the subnet requirements and maximize the number of hosts
We need to create subnets for 16 new sites from the 2001:DB8::/50 network.

Given 16 sites, we need 4 bits for the subnets (since 2^4 = 16). This leaves 14 bits for hosts within each subnet.

#### Calculate the Subnet Size:
- Original Network: 2001:DB8::/50
- Subnets required: 16 (requires 4 bits for subnets)
- Subnet Mask: /54 (50 + 4 = 54)

Thus, each subnet will be 2001:DB8::/54, which provides a significant number of hosts per subnet.

#### Second Subnet:
- Subnet: 2001:DB8:0:0:4000::/54
- Unique IPv6 Interface IDs for Sw101 and Sw102

### Assign IPv6 GUA:
- **Sw101**: An IPv6 GUA with a unique 64-bit interface identifier on e0/0: 2001:DB8:0:0:4000::1
- **Sw102**: An IPv6 GUA with a unique 64-bit interface identifier on e0/0: 2001:DB8:0:0:4000::FFFE

#### Configuration:
```shell
! Configuration for Sw101
interface e0/0
  ipv6 address 2001:DB8:0:0:4000::1/64
  no shutdown

! Configuration for Sw102
interface e0/0
  ipv6 address 2001:DB8:0:0:4000::FFFE/64
  no shutdown
```

With these configurations, the required subnets and IP addresses for Sw101 and Sw102 are assigned correctly, meeting the tasks' specifications.
