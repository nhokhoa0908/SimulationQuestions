Tasks
-

All physical cabling is in place. A company plans to deploy 64 new sites. The sites will utilize both IPv4 and IPv6 networks.

1. Subnet 10.30.64.0/19 to meet the subnet requirements and maximize the number of hosts
• Using the second subnet
- Assign the first usable IP address to e0/0 on Sw101
- Assign the last usable IP address to e0/0 on Sw102

2. Subnet 2001:db8::/56 to meet the subnet requirements and maximize the number of hosts
• Using the second subnet
- Assign an IPv6 GUA using a unique 64-Bit interface identifier on e0/0 on Sw101
- Assign an IPv6 GUA using a unique 64-Bit interface identifier on e0/0 on Sw102

### Task 1: Subnet 10.30.64.0/19

1. **Determine the subnet size and number of subnets**:
   - 10.30.64.0/19 provides a range of 10.30.64.0 - 10.30.95.255 (8,192 IP addresses).
   - The subnet mask for /19 is 255.255.224.0.

2. **Calculate the second subnet**:
   - The subnets within 10.30.64.0/19 will be 10.30.64.0/25, 10.30.64.128/25, 10.30.65.0/25, and so on. To maximize the number of hosts, we need to use /25 subnets.
   - The second subnet using /25 is 10.30.64.128/25.

3. **Assign the first and last usable IP addresses**:
   - The first usable IP in the subnet 10.30.64.128/25 is 10.30.64.129.
   - The last usable IP in the subnet 10.30.64.128/25 is 10.30.64.254.

**Commands to configure the IP addresses on SW101 and SW102**:

```shell
! SW101
interface e0/0
 ip address 10.30.64.129 255.255.255.128

! SW102
interface e0/0
 ip address 10.30.64.254 255.255.255.128
```

### Task 2: Subnet 2001:db8::/56

1. **Determine the subnet size and number of subnets**:
   - 2001:db8::/56 provides a large number of subnets.
   - The /64 subnets within 2001:db8::/56 will be 2001:db8:0:0::/64, 2001:db8:0:1::/64, 2001:db8:0:2::/64, and so on.

2. **Calculate the second subnet**:
   - The second subnet is 2001:db8:0:1::/64.

3. **Assign IPv6 GUA using unique 64-bit interface identifiers**:
   - An example of IPv6 GUAs using unique identifiers could be 2001:db8:0:1::1/64 and 2001:db8:0:1::2/64.

**Commands to configure the IPv6 addresses on SW101 and SW102**:

```shell
! SW101
interface e0/0
 ipv6 address 2001:db8:0:1::/64

! SW102
interface e0/0
 ipv6 address 2001:db8:0:1::/64
```
