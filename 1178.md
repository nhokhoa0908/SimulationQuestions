
### Task 1: Configure a route on R1 to ensure that R1 prefers R2 when traffic is destined to the server only.

#### **R1**
```shell
R1(config)# ip route 10.0.41.10 255.255.255.255 10.0.12.2
```

### Task 2: Configure a default route on R2 to the ISP.

#### **R2**
```shell
R2(config)# ip route 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 209.165.200.225
```

### Task 3: Configure a route on R1 to ensure that R1 will use R2 for the R4 LAN if the link fails between R3 and R4.

#### **R1**
```shell
R1(config)# ip route 10.0.41.0 255.255.255.0 10.0.12.2 10
```

### Task 4: Configure a route on R1 to ensure that R1 prefers R3 when traffic is destined to the R4 LAN at 10.0.41.0/24.

#### **R1**
```shell
R1(config)# ip route 10.0.41.0 255.255.255.0 10.0.13.2
```

### Verify and Save the Configurations

#### **R1**
```shell
R1# show ip route
R1# copy running-config startup-config
```

#### **R2**
```shell
R2# show ip route
R2# copy running-config startup-config
```

By following these steps, the static routing configuration on R1 and R2 will be set up as required, ensuring proper routing to the ISP and LAN behind R4.
